# Attrition_Report_Dashboard-PowerBi


# Overview
This project involves the creation of a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze employee attrition within an organization. The goal is to identify trends and key metrics that can provide insights into the factors contributing to employee turnover.

# Project Workflow

   ## 1. Import Data in Power BI
      The first step involved importing the relevant data into Power BI. The dataset included employee information, attrition status, and various other factors such as age, 
      department, job satisfaction, and more.

   ## 2. Data Cleaning & Processing
      Before analysis, the data was cleaned and processed to ensure accuracy and reliability. The following tasks were performed:

      - Removal of duplicates and unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset.
      
      - Handling missing values by either imputing or removing them, depending on the context.
      
      - Transforming and normalizing data to ensure consistency, including adjusting formats and correcting data types.
      
      - Creation of new calculated columns to extract meaningful insights, such as tenure or age group categories.

   ## 3. Power BI Dashboard - KPIs
      Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were created to provide quick, at-a-glance metrics related to attrition. These included:

     - Overall Attrition Rate
     - Attrition Rate by Department
     - Attrition Rate by Job Role
     - Average Tenure of Employees

   ## 4. Power BI Dashboard - Charts & Tables
     To visualize the data and make the analysis intuitive, various charts and tables were included in the dashboard:

    - Bar charts to show attrition rates by department, job role, and other factors.
    - Pie charts to represent the distribution of employees by categories such as job satisfaction or age groups.
    - Line charts to analyze trends over time, such as changes in attrition rate or tenure.
    - Tables to provide detailed views of the data, allowing for drill-down into specific metrics.

# Usage
The dashboard is designed to be interactive, allowing users to filter data and explore the factors influencing employee attrition. By analyzing the provided KPIs and visualizations, stakeholders can identify areas for improvement and develop strategies to reduce turnover.

# Conclusion
This Power BI dashboard serves as a powerful tool for analyzing employee attrition, helping organizations understand the underlying causes and take proactive steps to improve retention rates.
